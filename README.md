# Space-Dodger-Reloaded
Recreation of the SDL Space Dodger game from first year

TODO:
- Create a scene manager: static functions, creates and contains scenes, keeps track of current scene
- Create scene class: contains and handles entities/gameobjects, components and component systems (if I decide to go this route)
